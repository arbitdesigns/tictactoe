This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking X or O on the board until one player gets three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice Python programming skills and basic game development concepts. The code is well-commented and easy to follow, making it accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of Python.

Features:

    - Two-player mode where two people can play against each other
    - Single-player mode where the player competes against an AI opponent
    - Board display using ASCII characters
    - Error handling for invalid user inputs

Feel free to fork, modify and improve upon the code. Contributions are always welcome!
